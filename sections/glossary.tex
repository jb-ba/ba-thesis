\subsection{Fog Computing}
Fog computing describes the architectural style of carrying out computation, storage and communication (locally) at the edge of the network \citep{fogComputing:def}. It thus brings with it a whole new set of problems and challenges compared to the cloud. According to \citep{Introducing:kubeedge}, a senior software engineer in the field cloud messaging and IoT platforms at Red Hat, its three main advantages over the cloud are: "Low latency, availability and locality". 

\subsubsection{OSI Model}
Similarly to the Kubernetes and Istio documentation this report will use the 7-Layer OSI model \cite{IstioLayers61:online}


\subsection{CI/CD}
CI/CD is an automated approach to software development. CI stands for continuous integration and means continuously merging working code with the master branch, while testing for code quality via unit and integration tests \citep{shahin2017continuous}. CD stands for continuous development (sometimes also deployment) and means running
