\subsubsection{Single Vs Multi-Cluster}
Google recently revealed a new and much hyped product, Anthos\cite{TechnicalAnthosGoogle66:online}. Its a combination of many services, but most importantly it lets people easily manage hybrid clouds. Google describes it as follow: "Anthos is a modern application management platform that provides a consistent development and operations experience for cloud and on-prem environments"\cite{TechnicalAnthosGoogle66:online}. Google provides an installer for on-prem but onece installed Google itself manages the cluster including updates and troubleshooting. Not only is it a multi-cluster solution, but it also integrates the clusters with Istio service mesh and other neat features. Open source Kubernetes only has the multi-cluster management solution called Kubernetes Cluster Federation.
