\section{Analysis} \label{sec:analysis}
The analysis section will be split into different segments: Container technology, Kubernetes, Edge protocols and the IoT/edge stack, and, finally, the requirements for the implementation. Essentially, the analysis will be the foundation of the implementation giving reason to the major design choices described in the requirements.
In this thesis I will deploy containers to the edge using Kubernetes to see what is missing and what features already enable Kubernetes to make this possible.
Standardization of the edge is going to be key.
