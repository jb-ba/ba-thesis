\section{Analysis} \label{sec:analysis}
The analysis will be the foundation of the implementation, giving reason to the design choices taken in the Implementation. The section will be split into three parts: Use cases, requirements specification and the desired system architecture. The use cases will be used to gather the requirements. The desired system architecture is then a theoretical concept implementing all requirements.
