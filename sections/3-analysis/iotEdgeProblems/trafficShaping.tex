\subsubsection{Traffic Control and Shaping}
Traffic control and traffic shaping are very interesting edge topics. In Kubernetes each pod can be assigned incoming and outgoing bandwidth rates. But other tools extend this functionality and open up new possibilities. Istio, a service mesh mainly developed for Kubernetes, injects a sidecar proxy to fine tune the traffic of each container. It makes it possible to do rate limiting, control headers, reroute connection, change retries attempts, circuit breaking, mirroring and more while not changing the application code. Additionally, it is also able to encrypt traffic inside the mesh without the application knowing about it and gather all the telemetry data of the cluster. \\
With Kubernetes and tools extending its capabilities it is possible to do both traffic control and traffic shaping on a fine grained level. But, especially Istio, comes at the cost of additional overhead and the operator has to decide if the added functionality are worth the performance hit. Without Istio traffic control and shaping is only possible through the Kubernetes Ingress and thus in multi-cluster solutions.\\
Finally, Kubernetes is only meant to work with the Internet protocol stack and is only meant to operate within the clusters boundaries. So the actual communication with the IoT devices can not be controlled or shaped with Kubernetes.
