\subsubsection{Security}
Security in IoT is one of the biggest challenges in IoT. In 2016 a botnet with over 600k infected devices, primarily edge and IoT devices, overwhelmed several high-profile targets like the DNS provider Dyn with massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. This caused a temporary outage of their DNS servers making many webpages, among others  Twitter, Spotify and Amazon, temporally inaccessible. To combat those certain methods have been developed. I will analyze the direct container security aspects as they are always applicable for containers. Other methods, like specifically developed OSs and securing the CI/CD pipeline are not discussed at this point.\\
