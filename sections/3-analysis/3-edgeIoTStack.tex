\subsection{The IoT/Edge Problems}
Resource consumption and orchestration are big problems in the cloud. But, that does not mean they are not equally, or even more so, for the edge. Containers and Kubernetes can be adopted to consume less resources and Kubernetes enables remote orchestration of on-prem nodes. Because of the heterogenity of the edge, it faces even more problems. Discussed in this section will be load balancing, protocol conversion and traffic shaping.
