\subsection{Candidate Technologies}
Traditionally, edge devices were isolated cluster heads mainly forwarding traffic from their slaves to the cloud. Today, they are an integral part of the data flow pre-processing data and executing part of the business logic. This software needs to be managed and with the increase number of device it is clear that the solution has to be centralized and efficient. There are  chapter will compare four different approaches on how to do this: local management, centralized management. \\
First,

IoT cluster solutions\\
Isolated k8s cluster: Solution k3s\\
Kubernetes cluster where edge is part of the cloud: kubeedge\\
