% \subsubsection{Hardware Access}
Hardware access is very important on the edge, but not so much in the cloud. Servers rarely communicate via different protocols or use different peripherals. On the edge access to bluetooth or usb sticks is very important. Sharing host resources with a container is possible through the \textit{privileged} flag set at deploy time. In a nutshell, a container has its own filesystem, network and process tree and cannot access resources outside of this scope. Using the \textit{privileged} flag gives a container access to the host containers resources. Containerd offers many ways to fine tune how much privileges the container should get. It is for example possible to only expose the hosts network namespace and not the process namespace or filesystem.

This is done in the implementation \cref{} \nameref{} to reduce security risks. However, these resources are not controlled by Kubernetes and need to be managed by the operator.
