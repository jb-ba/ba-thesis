\subsection{Definitions} \label{sec:definitions}
The IoT communication landscape is often hard to understand, especially because terms are loosely and inconsistently defined. The same is true for the cloud but to a lesser extend. It uses less diverse technologies and which makes it less confusion. This section will explain the network topology, key terms and their concepts as the foundation for the following report.\\
\vspace{0.5mm} \ \\
\textbf{\textit{Network Topology}}\\
\Cref{fig:networkTopology3Layer} shows the network topology used in this report. 
% The focus will be on the management and security of the device edge as well as its interaction with the IoT devices themselves. 
\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{figure}

The upper two layers, the cloud and cloudlets, have a shared control plane. In case the edge deploys its own control plane without connection to the cloud, we will still refer to these devices as cloudlets. The cloud is defined by always available and infinite data storage and processing power. In  is operated by the network providers and is mainly used to provide access to the network to households and companies. It provides some services, e.g. to improve network characteristics such as to lower latency. But, devices operating in this layer are not directly related to IoT and thus excluded in this report.\\
The device edge is operated by normal households and other non network-related businesses. It is respsonsible for the control and data plane of the constrained devices (explained below). The data produced from these devices can be aggregated and processed in this layer. The benefits of doing so are discussed in chapter xxx.

\textbf{\textit{Constrained Device}}\\
Constraint devices are the elementary part of the IoT 
making up the "things" or devices\cite{contstraintDevicesTerminology}.
They can have three main purposes.
Either sensing or actuating (or both), where sensing is the 
passive action of measuring the environment (e.g. a motion detector) and actuating is the active action of influencing the environment (e.g. control of pressure in test tube). Or, finally, they can be smart objects enhancing the interaction between other smart objects and people.\\
They are usually defined by their limitation, mainly, small computing power (CPU, RAM, storage etc.) and limited power supply and operate in constrained network\footnote{See \cite{contstraintDevicesTerminology} page 5 for more information.}.\\
In summary, it is fair to assume that many constrained devices have very limited computing power, operate on battery in constrained networks using protocols like BLE and ZigBee. \\
\vspace{0.5mm} \ \\
\textbf{\textit{Smart/mobile devices}}\\
Smart devices are not clearly defined in the academic literature. In this report I will use the definition given by \citeauthor{poslad2011smartDevices}\cite{poslad2011smartDevices}, to clearly divide them from constrained devices. They are traditional computing devices and "tend to be multi purpose ICT devices"\cite{poslad2011smartDevices}, examples are mobile phones (smart phones) or tablets. They connect to the rest of the infrastructure directly but are free to move between networks. They also often rely on battery power and, importantly, are mainly end user devices. This has important privacy implication and is a major factor for edge computing.\\
\vspace{0.5mm} \ \\
\textbf{\textit{IoT Gateway}}\\
IoT Gateways are the connection between constrained devices and a network, this could be a local network or even the Internet. They facilitate inter-network and intra-network communications and because smart devices and especially constrained devices often communicate via wireless and non-Internet protocols, IoT gateways often translate protocols "between wireless sensor networks [...] traditional communication networks"\cite{zhu2010iotGatewayDefinition}.
In recent years IoT Gateways have become a major field of interest and new research. As these devices got more powerful, developers started using them for preprocessing and datagathering locally at the edge.
In conclusion, IoT gateways can take a wide variety of forms. They can be simple L3 routers or more powerful devices. Importantly, they are situated at the edge of a network and act as bridge between two autonomous systems.\\

\textbf{\textit{Edge node}}\\
Edge nodes are defined as nodes "that act as an end user portal for communication with other
nodes in cluster computing"\cite{Whatised17:edgeNodeDef}.
It operates on the edge, it must be able to run containers, has far inferior processing power compared to servers and can (only) run as a worker node (also known as a minion in kubernetes)\cite{NodesKub7:edgeNodeMinion}. Note that, this is in contrast to IBM which defines edge nodes as ingress traffic nodes in a cluster\cite{IBMCloudEdgeNodes0:online}.
In this report an edge node is a powerful IoT gateway situated at the edge of the network. Because of new and exciting developments it will not be restricted by the type of software it can run (it can thus be a master node as well), but rather by its network topology and mobility. It is a node without reliable and fast connection to the rest of the network, does not need a static IP and is (somewhat) portable\footnote{Comparing edge nodes to cloud nodes is also common academic practice\cite{contstraintDevicesTerminology}  but not considered at this point.}.
Reoccurring themes are the restrictions compared to cloud clusters, which are smaller processing power,
no permament connection to the backbone network and greater portability.\\
\vspace{0.5mm} \ \\
\textbf{\textit{Edge cluster}}\\
The term edge cluster is closely related to cluster technologies like Kubernetes or Mesos.
Edge clusters are computers powerful enough to run a full control plane of the cluster technology.
However, there is no clear definition of what constitutes 
to an edge cluster in neither the academic literature nor the industry.
They are more powerful edge nodes, often packing additional hardware like GPUs or SSDs.
However, emerging technologies like tiny builds of a full Kubernetes cluster
like K3s from Rancher Labs\cite{k3sLight14:online} make this distinction 
between edge nodes and edge clusters
increasingly difficult
\footnote{Rancher provides a 40MB Kubernetes binary and claims that 500MB of RAM is sufficient 
it stable.}.\\
Because of their similarities, in this report the distinction between edge nodes and clusters will be solely
made up on the cluster topology separating them on an architectural level.
