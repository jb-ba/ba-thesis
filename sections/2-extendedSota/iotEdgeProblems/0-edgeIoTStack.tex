\subsubsection{The IoT/Edge Problems} \label{edgeIoT}
*** Put this under Kubernetes and elimiate protocol stuff***

The heterogenity of the edge has given rise to the development of very diverse protocols and standards. Communication is not the only differentiator from the cloud however. Load balancing and traffic shaping is significantly different on the edge. For starters, cloud nodes seldomly lose Internet connection or run out of processing power. They also have very fast connections. Not discussed in this section will be the issue of ultra low latency. \\[0.5mm]
