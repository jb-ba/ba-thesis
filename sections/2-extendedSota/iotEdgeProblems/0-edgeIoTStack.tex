\subsection{The IoT/Edge Problems} \label{edgeIoT}
The heterogenity of the edge has given rise to the development of very different protocols and standards. Communication is not the only differentiator from the cloud however. Load balancing and traffic shaping is significantly different on the edge. For starters, nodes do not need 
Not thoroughly discussed in this section will be the issue of ultra low latency.
