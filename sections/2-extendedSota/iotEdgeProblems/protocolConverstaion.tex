% \subsubsection{IoT Protocols and Protocol Conversation}
Kubernetes was designed for the Inernet and not for the heterogenity of the edge. This means the IoT gateway must either implement a DHCP server, the IoT device must have a static IP or the communication is facilitate outside Kubernetes realm and then converted by a service to IP.\footnote{Please note that lower level protocols for establishing a connection between two devices, e.g. Ethernet, Wi-Fi (IEEE-802.11) or Bluetooth, are not discussed at this point.} The most common IoT protocols are MQTT, CoAP, AMQP and DDS. In contrast to the Internet protocol stack, these technologies do not need to support legacy systems and can thus concentrate on whats important in IoT, very low energy, distribution and memory consumption. I will compare MQTT\cite{MQTT50:online} to CoAP\cite{CoAPâ€”Con75:online} because of the their vast usage and academic literature.
