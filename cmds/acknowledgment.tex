{\textcolor{black}{\section*{\textcolor{black}{Acknowledgements}}}}
\noindent I thank my supervisor, Assoc. Prof. Henning Olesen, for his relentless support and guidance during the whole process.
Without his excellent feedback and thoughts this thesis would not have been possible.

\noindent I also thank my three study colleagues, Jonas Hansen, Steven Gertsen and Aleksander Nowak. They made my bachelor studies a blessing and a life time experience. We had so many fun moments, moments of frustration and moments of happy hand-ins. Only remembering them fills me with joy. I would not have been able to excel in my studies without their current input and discussions about technology and course material.

\noindent I thank my family and friends for simply being there in every step of my life.
